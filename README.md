# Psyris Project

## Overview
Psyris is a comprehensive data analysis and research tool designed for the field of psychology. The project aims to streamline various aspects of psychological research, from literature review to data analysis and visualization.

## Key Features
1. **Automated Literature Review**: Tools for efficiently gathering and analyzing research papers.
2. **Data Pipelines**: Processes for transforming raw data (e.g., from Excel or other formats) into structured, analysis-ready formats.
3. **Qualitative Data Analysis**: Tools and methodologies for analyzing qualitative research data.
4. **Quantitative Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis tools for quantitative psychological research.
5. **Flexible Project Structure**: Organized directory structure for managing code, data, documentation, and other resources.
6. **Isolated Environment**: Custom bash environment for project isolation and sandboxing.
